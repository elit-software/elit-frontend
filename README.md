## Developing Using Source Files

To use the source files, you will need to have npm installed globally along with Gulp.js. To start:
* Run `npm install` in the root directory
* Run `gulp dev` and edit the files as needed

If you need to update the plugins included with this template, simply run the following tasks:
* First run `npm update` to update the dependencies
* Then run `gulp copy` to copy the new versions to their proper destinations
